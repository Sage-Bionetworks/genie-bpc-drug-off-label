## Introduction   

At our January 2024 meeting we discussed the low utility of old FDA labels.  One solution to this is discarding old drugs, but we have to decide on a cutoff.  This document presents some information to help us make that choice.


```{r}

dft_first_approvals <- dft_ind_mapped |> 
  filter(!is.na(date) & !is.na(mapped_agent)) |> 
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) |>
  group_by(mapped_agent) |>
  summarize(
    first_global_date = min(date, na.rm = T),
    first_fda_date = min(date[regulator == "FDA"], na.rm = T),
    num_rows_fda = sum(regulator == "FDA", na.rm = T),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |> 
  arrange(first_global_date)

# eyeballed list - not scientific at all
vec_heavy_violators <- c(
  "Leucovorin Calcium",
  "Oxaliplatin",
  "Carboplatin",
  "Irinotecan Hydrochloride",
  "Cisplatin",
  "Gemcitabine Hydrochloride",
  "Leuprolide Acetate",
  "Etoposide",
  "Methotrexate",
  # < 20 violations:
  "Paclitaxel",
  "Goserlin Acetate",
  "Mitomycin",
  "Vinblastine Sulfate",
  # And a few that pop up tons of times in the "anytime use" list:
  "Vinorelbine Tartrate",
  "Trastuzumab Emtansine",
  "Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride",
  # < 100 violations:
  "Docetaxel"
)

dft_freq_viol <- dft_first_approvals %>%
  filter(mapped_agent %in% vec_heavy_violators) %>%
  arrange(first_fda_date)
```


## Working backwards

At this point we've already generated lists of possible off-label uses.  The lists we generated are in those with "first and only" cancers for simplicity, and we generated them for both first drug uses (first day of drug use after dx) and overall.

Empirically there are about 15 drugs that have (roughly, just eyeballing) dozens of possible violations.  Working backward, one approach is to look at the approval date for these and see if they tend to be earlier than a certain date.  Here is that list:

```{r}
dft_freq_viol %>%
  flextable(.) %>%
  autofit(.)
```

Notes:

- With one exception these drugs which seem to generate an excessive number of hits have a global approval date before 1997 - somewhere around there could be a good cutoff.
  - I think the year 2000 was suggested at a meeting, aligns well with this.
- `num_rows_fda` refers to how many rows there are in the indications.csv sheet for which `regulator == "FDA"`.

## What is excluded

Suppose we exclude drugs which have a first global approval date of before 1997.  We will want to know (1) what drugs that excludes and (2) what proportion of drug uses are included/excluded at various cutoff dates.

The following table shows the drugs sorted by global approval date:

```{r}
DT::datatable(
  dft_first_approvals,
  style = "bootstrap4"
)
```

Notes:

- About 39 drugs exluded and 86 included if we use a global approval date of 1997.
- Most of the immunotherapies and biologics our team expressed interest in seem to still be there if we throw out all drugs approved before 1997 - a notable exception is Doxorubicin.
- Using an FDA approval date cutoff could work too.  For those never approved by the FDA we could just include them in our analysis (it could not be more clear that they're off label if used in the US).



```{r}
gg_cutoff_drug_uses <- dft_hdrug_ind %>%
  left_join(
    .,
    select(dft_first_approvals, agent = mapped_agent, first_global_date),
    by = "agent"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(
    .,
    aes(x = first_global_date, color = cohort)
  ) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = ymd("1997-01-01"), linetype = "12") +
  stat_ecdf() + 
  scale_x_date(
    name = "Cutoff date choice"
  ) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Proportion of <br>drug uses <br>excluded",
    breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.25),
    labels = paste0(seq(0, 1, by = 0.25) * 100, "%")
  ) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_color_vibrant()
    
```

The following shows the proportion of drug uses included using various cutoff dates:
