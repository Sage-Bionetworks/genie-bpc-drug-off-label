## Introduction

This is a working document for analyses related to the Off-label & Off-guideline manuscript chaired by Jeremy Warner.

The regimen/drug data is filtered in all tables to **exclude Investigational Drugs**.  Updated to also exclude any agent used as a part of a clinical trial (`drugs_ct_yn`) in Feb 2024.

### Cohort filters

Filtering of the raw BPC data we will apply to all items except for R1.1:

- Only participants with a **single** cancer diagnosis are included ("first and only" cancers in GENIE BPC).
- Only US sites will be considered (we have a small number in Canada in BPC).

Pre-processing of the data that will apply to all tables and figures:

- "Non-standard" drug administration routes will be eliminated when known.
  - Our definition of standard and nonstandard comes from the `drugs_admin` variable.  
  - This variable is **not populated for the pancreas, prostate and NSCLC cohorts**, but only for bladder, breast and colorectal.  This means that we cannot exclude non-standard routes in those three cohorts unless additional rules are added.
  - The two biggest examples of drugs with non-standard routes are BCG vaccine (intravesical in bladder cohort) and Floxuridine (other route in CRC).
  - Standard routes are "orally, intravenously or by infusion".
  - Non-standard routes are "Intraperitoneal (direct into the abdominal cavity), Intrapleural (direct into the pleural space around the lung), Intralesional (direct into a lesion), Intrathecal (by spinal catheter), Intravesical (bladder installation), Other."
- We will also just completely ignore some drugs due to the lack of perfection in the `drugs_admin` variable.  These are currently BCG Vaccine, BCG Solution and Floxuridine.
  
**Definitions:**

- *index cancer* - The cancer diagnosis that qualified the participant for curation into a BPC cohort (e.g. to be in the prostate cohort you must have a prostate cancer matching a set of Oncotree codes).
- *F&O* - First and only cancer diagnosis.  Meaning that the only known cancer for this participant was the one that qualitified them for inclusion in a GENIE BPC cohort.
- *repeat regimens* - If a participant has a regimen with drugs {A,B,C} and the very next regimen in their record is {A,B,C} again, that second regimen is a repeat regimen.  If they use {A,B,C,D} or {A,B} in their next regimen that doesn't count.

## Ch 1 - BPC data description

### R1.1 Cohort filtering impact

Now that we're filtering to F&O, we have some room to describe additional quanitites of our cohort filtering.  Four quantities are shown:

- `n_pts` - The number of unique patients.
- `n_cancers` - The number of cancers in those patients.  Note that this is the same for the First & Only cohort because each person has exactly one cancer.
- `n_reg` - The number of regimens, using the unaltered definition used in GENIE BPC.  This does not include invesigational 
- `n_unique_drug` - The number of unique drugs observed among all the regimens.

```{r, include = T}
dfp_filtering_impact %>%
  flextable(.) %>%
  flextable::merge_v(j = 'quantity') %>%
  flextable::fix_border_issues(.) %>%
  flextable::valign(j = 'quantity', valign = 'top') %>%
  flextable::bg(i = c(2,4,6,8), bg = '#e6ecf2')
```

From this point on the tables deal only with the *First & Only* cases.




```{r}
dft_hreg_cohort <- dft_cohort_cases %>%
  select(hreg) %>%
  unnest(hreg) %>%
  fix_cohort_names(.)

dft_hdrug_cohort <- dft_cohort_cases %>%
  select(cohort, hdrug) %>%
  unnest(hdrug)
```




```{r}
dfp_reg_sum <- dft_hreg_cohort %>%
  group_by(cohort, regimen_drugs) %>%
  summarize(
    n_regimens = n(),
    n_people = length(unique(record_id)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```


```{r, write_excel_data_reg, include = F}
dfp_reg_sum %>%
  arrange(cohort, regimen_drugs) %>%
  readr::write_csv(
    x = .,
    file = here('output', 'regimen_counts_by_cohort.csv')
  )
```

### R1.2a Drugs used (as regimens)

See the **attached CSV** (regimen_counts_by_cohort.csv) for the full list of regimens observed in each cohort.  Again, this does not include any regimens with investigational agents, and we have filtered each group to F&O cancers.

For convenience, the following table supports simple text searching (not case sensitive).  For example, if you type "Carboplatin bladder" you should see all summaries for the drug carboplatin in the bladder cohort.

Each row shows the number of regimens with those drugs we have in the data (`n_regimens`) and the number of people who had at least one regimen with those exact drugs (`n_people`).

```{r print_reg_table, show = T, include = T}
dt_wrapper(dfp_reg_sum)
```




```{r}
dfp_drug_sum <- dft_hdrug_cohort %>% 
  group_by(cohort, agent) %>%
  summarize(
    n_uses = n(),
    n_people = length(unique(record_id)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

```{r, write_excel_data_drug, include = F}
dfp_drug_sum %>%
  arrange(cohort, agent) %>%
  readr::write_csv(
    x = .,
    file = here('output', 'drug_use_counts_by_cohort.csv')
  )
```

### R1.2b Drugs used (as drugs)

The following content is the same information as the previous table, counted as separate drugs (agents) rather than using the BPC regimen rules.  Each row shows the number of regimens which used that drug in the data (`n_uses`) and the number of people who had at least one regimen using this agent (`n_people`).

See the **attached CSV** (drug_use_counts_by_cohort.csv) for the full list of drugs observed in each cohort.  


```{r print_drug_table, show = T, include = T}
dt_wrapper(dfp_drug_sum)
```


```{r}
# fxd = first x days analyses
dft_hdrug_fxd <- dft_hdrug_cohort %>%
  group_by(record_id, ca_seq) %>%
  mutate(
    dx_first_drug_use_int = min(dx_drug_start_int, na.rm = T)
  ) %>%
  ungroup(.)

dfp_first_drug_sum <- dft_hdrug_fxd %>%
  filter_drugs_first_x_days(
    ., 
    x = 0, # within 0 days to start.
    var_index_time = 'dx_first_drug_use_int'
  ) %>%
  group_by(cohort, agent) %>%
  summarize(
    # n_uses should be the same as n_people here.
    n_people = length(unique(record_id)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

dfp_first_30d_drug_sum <- dft_hdrug_fxd %>%
  filter_drugs_first_x_days(
    ., 
    x = 30, # within 30 days.
    var_index_time = 'dx_first_drug_use_int'
  ) %>%
  group_by(cohort, agent) %>%
  summarize(
    # n_uses should be the same as n_people here.
    n_people = length(unique(record_id)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```


### R1.3a First drugs used

Drugs which constitute the first recorded start date for each participant.  `n_uses` and `n_people` should be identical here, so we just state the latter.  If two drugs are started at the same time, both would appear in this table.

BPC regimen encoding does not factor into this table at all - we're examining drugs as separate entities and only looking at the time they were started.

```{r, print_first_drug_sum, include = T}
dt_wrapper(dfp_first_drug_sum)
```

### R1.3b Drugs used within 30 days of first

Drugs used within 30 days of the first drug use.  Similar to the previous table but allowing a 30 day window for the second drug start time.

```{r, print_first_30d_drug_sum, include = T}
dt_wrapper(dfp_first_30d_drug_sum)
```


```{r}
dft_second_drug_t_dist <- dft_hdrug_fxd %>%
  mutate(
    sec_drug_diff = dx_drug_start_int - dx_first_drug_use_int
  ) %>%
  filter(
    abs(sec_drug_diff) > 0.5
  ) %>%
  arrange(sec_drug_diff) %>%
  group_by(record_id, ca_seq) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup(.)


gg_sec_drug_t <- plot_time_dist_violin_ecdf(
  dat = dft_second_drug_t_dist,
  time_var = "sec_drug_diff",
  time_var_lab = "Second drug start interval (days from first drug)",
)

gg_sec_drug_t_400 <- plot_time_dist_violin_ecdf(
  dat = dft_second_drug_t_dist,
  time_var = "sec_drug_diff",
  time_var_lab = "Second drug start interval (days from first drug)",
  x_coord_cap = 400
)

```


### R1.3c Second drug start interval distribution

The quantity being displayed here is the time from the start of the first drug to the start of the second drug in days (excluding those started on the same day as the first drug).  

For example, if someone started drug A on day 0, drug B on day 0, and drug C on day 28, this plot would show the difference between drugs A and C, 28 days (repeated for all participants).

```{r, include = T, fig.height = 3}
gg_sec_drug_t
```

A version of the same plot zooming in on the first year (approximately), where most of the action is:

```{r, include = T, fig.height = 3}
gg_sec_drug_t_400
```




```{r}

dft_met_timing <- dft_cohort_cases %>%
  mutate(
    met_timing = purrr::map(
      .x = ca_ind,
      .f = (function(x) {
        make_dmet_status_block(x) %>%
          filter(
            dmet_status %in% "Distant Metastasis"
          ) %>%
          # years -> days
          mutate(dx_met_days = dx_block_start * 365.25) %>%
          select(
            record_id,
            ca_seq,
            dx_met_days
          )
      })
    )
  ) %>%
  select(cohort, met_timing) %>%
  unnest(met_timing)

dft_hdrug_met <- left_join(
    dft_hdrug_cohort,
    dft_met_timing,
    by = c("cohort", "record_id", "ca_seq")
  )

dft_hdrug_met %<>%
  # only cases where a metastasis was noted
  filter(!is.na(dx_met_days)) %>%
  mutate(dmet_drug_start_int = dx_drug_start_int - dx_met_days) %>%
  # only drugs started on or after the time of metastasis
  filter(dmet_drug_start_int > -0.1) 

dft_hdrug_met %<>%
  group_by(cohort, record_id, ca_seq) %>%
  mutate(
    dmet_first_drug_int = min(
      dmet_drug_start_int, 
      na.rm = T
    )
  ) %>%
  ungroup(.)


```


```{r}
dfp_first_drug_met_sum <- dft_hdrug_met %>%
  filter_drugs_first_x_days(
    ., 
    x = 0, # within 0 days to start.
    var_index_time = 'dmet_first_drug_int'
  ) %>%
  group_by(cohort, agent) %>%
  summarize(
    # n_uses should be the same as n_people here.
    n_people = length(unique(record_id)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

```


### R1.4a First drugs used (metastatic setting)

This only examines drugs started on or after a metastatic diagnosis (de novo or not), and of course only in patients where that diagnosis was made at some point.

As with the previous plots, if a second drug was started on the same day as the first drug, it will appear in this table.


```{r, include = T}
dt_wrapper(dfp_first_drug_met_sum)
```

Note:  This list has about 70% as many rows (combinations of cohort and agent) as the one for all participants in this cohort.


## Ch 2 - Lines of therapy 

### R2.1 Rules for building lines 

*Note: This deals with patients of all stages for the moment.  I know that's an abuse of the term "lines of therapy" but I'm just trying to address the strategy for restacking drugs into therapy lines.

At our October meeting we discussed the intricacies of BPC cancer regimens and how they can be overlapping, ajoining, etc. depending on the type of therapy addressed.  Jeremy proposed a simple start for this:

- The first line is the first aggregation of anti-cancer therapies.  This means that they must overlap, but they do not need to start on the same day.

After looking into the regimen data a bit further I would suggest that we need some pre-processing steps as well.  These include:

1. For two drug uses that start and end on adjoining days, or overlap further, we should join them into one "use".  
  - Examples:  GENIE-DFCI-008121 in the CRC cohort, regimens 2 and 3. GENIE-DFCI-053242 for bicalutamide below.
2. Any drug uses of zero days (to the best of our knowledge) should be eliminated.  I believe many of these just appear to be zero days because there is not yet a confirmed discontinuation date.
  - Examples:  GENIE-DFCI-007616 in the NSCLC cohort, regimen 3.
  
#### Example case #1

The following plot is **interactive** - hover over each rectangle for more information.  The colors are the GENIE BPC regimen number.

This person's first line would be a four drug regimen, which happens to be their regimen 1 in GENIE BPC.

```{r, include = T}
dft_hdrug_cohort %>%
  filter(record_id %in% 'GENIE-MSK-P-0020681') %>%
  plot_drug(., return_plotly = T)
```

**Proposed handling:** This person's first line would be a four drug regimen of Floxuridine and the 3 drugs that are part of BPC regimen #2.

#### Example case #2

```{r, include = T}
dft_hdrug_cohort %>%
  filter(record_id %in% 'GENIE-DFCI-053242') %>%
  plot_drug(., return_plotly = T)
```

**Proposed handling:** This example would combine the Bicalutamide regimen's into one use in preprocessing.  The first line would be docetaxel, leuprolide and bicalutamide.  The Abiraterone Acetate administration would not cound in the first line because the docetaxel administration ended before this was started.


  
```{r, include = F}

dft_hreg_cohort %>% 
  filter(record_id %in% 'GENIE-VICC-116953')

dft_overlap_cases <- tribble(
  ~cohort, ~record_id, 
  'Breast', "GENIE-DFCI-000701", # possible sequence, not overlapping
  'Breast', 'GENIE-VICC-568921', # possible sequence, not overlapping
  'CRC', 'GENIE-VICC-116953', # stop/start lots
  'CRC', "GENIE-MSK-P-0007135", # stop/start lots
  'Pancreas', 'GENIE-MSK-P-0010984', # large buildup
  'CRC', 'GENIE-VICC-499960', # all over
) %>%
  mutate(ca_seq = 0)


dft_over_ex <- dft_overlap_cases

dft_over_ex %<>%
  mutate(
    drug_sub_case = purrr::pmap(
      .l = list(c = cohort, r = record_id, s = ca_seq),
      .f = \(c,r,s) {
        dft_hdrug_cohort %>%
          filter(
            cohort %in% c &
              record_id %in% r & 
              ca_seq %in% s
          )
      }
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    gg_drug_case = purrr::map(
      .x = drug_sub_case,
      .f = plot_drug
    )
  )

dft_over_ex %<>%
  mutate(
    plt_drug_case = purrr::map(
      .x = gg_drug_case,
      .f = \(x) {
        plotly::ggplotly(x, tooltip = 'text')
      }
    )
  )
  


```

### R2.2 Interesting cases to consider

#### Possible sequence, not overlapping

It's common in the breast cancer cohort to see a (seemingly planned) progression of drugs coded as one regimen, but they're not technically overlapping:

```{r, include = T}
dft_over_ex$plt_drug_case[[1]]
```


```{r, include = T}
dft_over_ex$plt_drug_case[[2]]
```

#### Many stops and starts

This is especially common in the CRC cohort:

```{r, include = T}
dft_over_ex$plt_drug_case[[3]]
```

```{r, include = T}
dft_over_ex$plt_drug_case[[4]]
```

This begs the question of whether we want to combine drug administrations which are close but not quite overlapping.

#### Large buildup of for one line

Occasionally someone would qualify for something like a 7-drug regimen:

```{r, include = T}
dft_over_ex$plt_drug_case[[5]]
```

#### Generally complex

```{r, include = T}
dft_over_ex$plt_drug_case[[6]]
```




## Ch 3 - Joining to indications

### R3.0 Linkage Strategy

To generate a list of potential approvals we will join two datasets:

- Jeremy Warner's indications sheet, which lists about 3000 rows of approvals over several regulatory agencies.
- The regimen BPC data, reshaped to be one row per drug rather than one row per regimen.  Filtering described in chapter 1 generally applies.
  - Additionally, we excluded **any drug approved before 1997** as those labels tend to be discordant with practice. 

The concepts we are joining on are:

- Warner's `condition` is mapped to BPC `cohort`.
- Warner's `component` is mapped to BPC `agent`.  `agent` is a reshape of drug names from the `regimen_drugs` column.

Obviously the text representations of these two concepts are slightly different, so we need some crosswalks to link them.  

#### Crosswalk: Conditions

```{r, include = T}
dft_cw_condition %>%
  flextable(.) %>% 
  autofit(.)
```

All other `condition` entries from the Warner list are unmapped/unused.  The full list of unused conditions is in an appendix.

#### Crosswalk: Component (drug)

Reminder: `agent` is directly pulled GENIE BPC's `regimen_drugs` after splitting up the drugs.  `component` is from Warner's indications sheet.

```{r, include = T}
dft_cw_drug %>%
  select(component, agent, agent_map_type) %>%
  dt_wrapper(.)
```

Notes:

- `agent_map_type` is just a short description of the strategy I used to make the link.  The levels are:
  - `exact`: The strings were a perfect (case-ignoring) match.
  - `trimmed`:  After trimming common suffixes from the BPC data (like "sulfate", "acetate") the strings were a perfect match.
  - `manual`:  Manual link, by someone with no medical or pharmacology training (!).
  



```{r}
vec_bpc_drugs <- dft_hdrug_det %>%
  pull(agent) %>%
  unique

vec_ind_drugs <- dft_ind_mapped %>%
  filter(mapped_agent %in% vec_bpc_drugs) %>%
  pull(mapped_agent) %>%
  unique

prop_uses_covered <- dft_hdrug_det %>%
  mutate(
    drug_in_ind = agent %in% vec_ind_drugs
  ) %>% 
  summarize(
    prop_uses_covered = mean(drug_in_ind, na.rm = T)
  ) %>%
  pull(prop_uses_covered) 


vec_bpc_drugs_not_mapped <- vec_bpc_drugs[!(vec_bpc_drugs %in% vec_ind_drugs)] %>% 
  sort %>%
  paste(., collapse = ", ")

```

#### Crosswalk success

- Of the `r length(vec_bpc_drugs)` unique drugs in our BPC cohorts, `r n_pct_str(length(vec_ind_drugs %in% vec_bpc_drugs), length(vec_bpc_drugs), show_d = F)` were found in the indications sheet after mapping.
  - The agents which we couldn't map to anything in the indications sheet are: `r vec_bpc_drugs_not_mapped`.  All used very few times in BPC.
- Of the `r nrow(dft_hdrug_det)` uses of a drug (one person using a drug for one block of time), `r round(prop_uses_covered*100, 3)`% involve a drug which was successfully mapped to a drug in the indications sheet.


### R3.1 Off label use def

Our definition of an on-label use is currently any use of a drug which has a matching row in the indications sheet that meets the following criteria:

1. A matching indication exists, meaning:

  - Regulator for the approval is FDA.
  - Condition maps to the BPC cohort of the drug use.
  - Component maps to the BPC agent (regimen drug) of the drug use.
  
2. If the indication a requires metastatic state, the drug use started after a metastatic diagnosis.

3. The drug start date is after the approval date for the drug.  Notes:

  - We do not have exact dates in GENIE BPC.  We calculate the maximum drug start date given a participant's `birth_year` (whole years) and the interval from birth date to start of the drug (an exact number of days) by assuming they were born on Dec 31.
  - Assuming people were born as late as possible is conservative in that we consider the fewest number possible off-label by date.
  - A later section will deal with the opposite assumption (taking the minimum possible drug start date).

Planned expansions to this definition include:

- Additional indications for non-cohort things like TMB for pembrolizumab.

**Off-label** use is a drug use which can't be verified as on-label according to the definition above under any indication in our sheet.

Each off label use is assigned a single "reason" it's off label, which means we have a priority system.  The following order is used:

- **No indications found** - There was no cancer type indication at all for this drug use.
- **Not metastatic at use** - The applicable drug indication required metastases at use and the participant did not have distant mets recorded when the drug was started.
- **Started before approval** - The drug was started before the approval date.

For example, if a participant uses a drug in 2015 while not metastatic, and the drug required metastases with it's only approval in 2017, that will count as "Not metastatic at use" (higher priority).  These can be shifted around, except for "no indication found".



```{r}

# Just a rename:

dfp_olu_cohort <- dft_hdrug_det %>%
  count_off_label(group_vars = c('cohort')) %>%

    off_label_uses = n_pct_str(n_off_label, n_uses, show_d = T)
  ) %>%

```

### R3.2 OLU Overview

By cohort (denominators show the number of total drug uses included):

```{r, include = T}
dfp_olu_cohort
```

### R3.3 OLU table, sortable

The following table shows rows grouped by {cohort, agent, off_label_type}.  For example, a row might show the number of off label uses of capecitabine in the pancreatic cohort, which were due to using a drug before the approval date.

### R3.4 OLU, sortable, first drug

The following table is the same as the previous one, except we limit to only the first day of drug use by each person:

### R4.1 OLU and regimen number

We observed previous that first drugs seem to be on label more frequently and hypothesized that later regimens may have more off label use.  The following graph is a rough expansion on that idea:

```{r, include = T}
gg_comb
```

**Notes:**

- Size of the dots is the number of observations we have at that regimen number (after all of our filtering).
- Proportions of regimens containing some off label use and the trend over time vary a lot by cohort.
- The most unusual group is pancreas, which has a high off label use proportion even for first line therapies.



```{r}
dft_poss_app %>% glimpse

# We just re-add the checks:
dft_hdrug_det_anti_conserv <- add_checks_possible_approvals(
  dat_poss_app = dft_poss_app,
  test_cols_to_include = c(
    'test_ind_exists',
    'test_met',
    'test_date_possible'
    # excluded:  'test_date_possible'
  )
) %>%

dft_date_compare <- left_join(
  (dft_hdrug_det %>%
     filter(!valid_ind_exists) %>%
     count(cohort, name = "conservative")),
  (dft_hdrug_det_anti_conserv %>%
     filter(!valid_ind_exists) %>%
     count(cohort, name = "anti_conserv")),
  by = "cohort"
)


```


### R4.2 Date assumptions

Previously we made the most conservative possible assumption on date of drug start.  That is, for each participant, we assumed that their birthday was the last day on their recorded `birth_year`.

We calculated the maximally anti-conservative assumption too:  That they were born on Jan 1 of their `birth_year`.  The following table shows the number of off label uses by cohort when we make those two assumptions:

```{r, include = T}
dft_date_compare %>%
  flextable(.) %>%
  autofit(.)
```

**Notes:**

- Another way to think about the difference between these two columns that it's the number of people who used a drug within the first year of approval.  We can't be sure if it was before or after approval.
- The subjects in the "fuzzy" period between our two assumptions would be costly to cure/query sites about.

### R4.3 Drug use dates (select)

#### R4.3.1 Pancreas, Capecitabine

In our March 2024 meeting we discussed the surprising number of off label uses in the Pancreas cohort for Capecitabine.  One possible explanation is the guidelines and papers showing efficacy coming out well before 2022 (with at least one important abstract in Jan 2017, marked in red below).  The plot below shows the maximum possible start times for Capecitabine in the Pancreas cohort, limited to the first use in each participant.

After seeing the results, we added a lower pane distribution for **all** drug uses (even those we're not considering as candidates for off-label use).  The point of this is to provide a comparator distribution for when subjects in this cohort were starting drugs overall.  

```{r, include = T}
cowplot::plot_grid(
  gg_panc_cape,
  gg_panc_all_drug,
  ncol = 1
)
```

**Notes:**

- At first glance, this looks hard to believe.  We have a bell shaped curve that shows no sensitivity at all to when the evidence or approval came out, and would roughly align with drug use for the cohort.
- Relevant dates for this cohort:  Sequenced from 2013-2018, Locked on Dec 31, 2020.
  - Sanity check:  Allowing 1 year for date uncertainty, we expect to have no drug start date "maximum" guesses before 2022.  This seems to be the case, which is good.
- There is a convenient fact reassuring me:  The lock date for the cohort was Dec 31, 2020, so no observations should have been made after that date, and the drug was not approved until 2022.  Therefore, any recorded use of the drug is automatically off label. 




```{r}
gg_pros_olaparib <- dft_hdrug_cohort %>%
  filter(
    cohort %in% "Prostate",
    agent %in% "Olaparib"
  ) %>%
  group_by(record_id) %>%
  arrange(drug_start_date_max) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup(.) %>%
  plot_drug_use_times(
    .,
    plot_title = "Prostate Olaparib uses (first in each patient)",
    plot_subtitle = "Blue = First FDA approval"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = ymd("2020-05-19"), color = "#33bbee") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = ymd(paste0(c(1994, 2023), "01-01")))

gg_pros_all_drug <- dft_hdrug_cohort %>%
  filter(
    cohort %in% "Prostate"
  ) %>%
  plot_drug_use_times(
    .,
    plot_title = "Prostate ALL drug uses",
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = ymd(paste0(c(1994, 2023), "01-01")))
```



#### R4.3.2 Prostate, Olaparib

The second most frequent cohort/drug combo which was taken before an approval was Prostate cancer + Olaparib.  I was motivated to look into this partially to see if the above plot could be a coding error.  Here is the distribution of start drug start times, with the distribution of start times for any drug as a comparison:

```{r, include = T}
cowplot::plot_grid(
  gg_pros_olaparib,
  gg_pros_all_drug,
  ncol = 1
)
```

**Notes:**

- Relevant dates:  The first approval of any kind for Olaparib was in 2014 (Ovarian cancer).  The prostate cancer cohort's lock date was 4/30/2021.
- This looks slightly better than the Pancreas example above, with no uses before mid-2015, which makes me less supsicious about a coding error.
- I'm still surprised the approval date appears to have no impact on use.






```{r}
gg_nsclc_ipili <- dft_hdrug_cohort %>%
  filter(
    cohort %in% "NSCLC",
    agent %in% "Ipilimumab"
  ) %>%
  group_by(record_id) %>%
  arrange(drug_start_date_max) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup(.) %>%
  plot_drug_use_times(
    .,
    plot_title = "NSCLC Ipilimumab uses (first in each patient)",
    plot_subtitle = "Blue = First FDA approval"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = ymd("2020-05-15"), color = "#33bbee") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = ymd(paste0(c(2002, 2022), "01-01")))

gg_nsclc_all_drug <- dft_hdrug_cohort %>%
  filter(
    cohort %in% "NSCLC"
  ) %>%
  plot_drug_use_times(
    .,
    plot_title = "NSCLC ALL drug uses",
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = ymd(paste0(c(2002, 2022), "01-01")))
```

#### R4.3.3 NSCLC + Ipilimumab

One more, skipping over the pembro cases which could be attributed to a TMB indication unrelated to cancer type: 

```{r, include = T}
cowplot::plot_grid(
  gg_nsclc_ipili,
  gg_nsclc_all_drug,
  ncol = 1
)
```

**Notes**

- This time it looks like 100% of the subjects who used the drug used it before the label update.
- First FDA approval for lung cancer:  2020 May 15, first approval for any cancer (melanoma) 2011 March 25.


### R4.4 Sites, OLU


```{r}
dft_panc_cases <- dft_all_cases %>%
  filter(cohort %in% "Pancreas") %>%
  select(ca_ind) %>%
  unnest(ca_ind) %>%
  mutate(site = infer_site_from_subject(record_id)) %>%
  count(site, name = "panc_cohort_cases") %>%
  filter(!(site %in% "UHN"))

dft_panc_sites <- dft_hdrug_det %>%
  mutate(site = infer_site_from_subject(record_id)) %>%
  filter(agent %in% "Capecitabine" & cohort %in% "Pancreas") %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarize(
    n_pts_capecitabine = length(unique(record_id))
  )

dft_panc_cases <- left_join(
  dft_panc_sites,
  dft_panc_cases,
  by = "site"
) %>%
  mutate(prop = n_pct_str(n_pts_capecitabine, panc_cohort_cases, show_d = T))


```

#### Pancreas + Capecitabine

The following table shows how many patients used capecitabine (automatically off label) in the pancreatic cohort.  The denominator we use to estimate the percentage is the number of total patients in each cohort from that site:

```{r}
#| include: true

dft_panc_cases %>%
  select(site, `Cape. \ Cohort` = prop) %>%
  flextable(.) %>%
  autofit(.)
```

**Notes:**

- Our hypothesis was that maybe this cohort of Capecitabine users was dominated by MSK, where we might expect more out-of-pocket payment.  This does not appear to be a strong effect, it's at all three sites and slightly more popular at MSK.

### *R4.5 Guidelines + Capecitabine

*Credit:* Thanks to Jennifer Hoppe for compiling and organizing all the NCCN guidelines.  This took care of the majority of work needed to get here, greatly appreciated.

We discussed above the possibility that the NCCN guidelines could precede approvals and have an impact on the way people treat.  The following graph shows the number of mentions of "cape", which tend to be things like "Capecitabine" and "CapeOx".  I excluded "Capello", which is an author's name appearing in the references later on.  This is normalized by the number of alphabetic (not alphanumeric) characters in the guideline, to adjust somewhat for the massive expansion in their size over time.


```{r, include = T, fig.height = 3}
gg_nccn_cape
```


**Notes**

- This was always intended to be a starting point to look more closely.  Here's what I found reading selectively:
  - 2007 closer look:  My reading is they're saying you can use Capecitabine as second line thearpy in advanced disease.  A study pops up in the references.
  - 2012 closer look:  Recommendations for use look expanded, adjuvant and neoadjuvant recommendations, and with radiation.  It also appears in flow charts now, and there's mentions of CapeOx and other combos.
  - 2017 closer look:  Seems recommended for tons of things at this point, a phase 3 trial pops up in the references which I think many in the group remembered.
- Even though guidelines may "explain" the use, it still seems interesting that they outpaced the approvals so dramatically.
- Some of the very old guidelines didn't parse (need OCR).  Because the first two years that *did* parse show no mentions I'm not going to bother messing with those.
- I also counted words and normalized that way.  The graphs have an extremely shape with alphabetic characters and words.
- We did not exclude references.  To me it seems fine if we "double count" both characters and capecitabine mentions, since our goal is just showing when the guidelines started talking about capecitabine.





```{r}
dft_gen_mark <- readr::read_rds(
  here('data', 'no_ca_seq_filter', 'genomic_sum.rds')
)

dfp_crc_biomarkers <- dft_hdrug_det %>% 
  filter(
    cohort %in% "CRC", 
    !valid_ind_exists, 
    agent %in% c("Trastuzumab", "Vemurafenib")
  ) %>%
  group_by(record_id, agent) %>%
  arrange(regimen_number) %>% 
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup(.) %>%
  mutate(`Record [reg]` = glue("{record_id} [{regimen_number}]")) %>%
  left_join(
    .,
    dft_gen_mark,
    by = "record_id"
  ) %>%
    mutate(`Record [reg]` = glue("{record_id} [{regimen_number}]")) %>%
  select(agent, `Record [reg]`, any_BRAF, any_ERBB2) %>%
  arrange(agent, `Record [reg]`)

```


### *R4.6 Biomarker driven use

We observed several off label uses of Traztuzumab and Vemurafenib in CRC above.  One hypothesis was that these participants may have had a genomic alteration in BRAF or ERBB2 which could explain the decision to administer these drugs.  The following table provides a flag for each one, ignoring timing entirely.  In other words, a BRAF mutation or amplification (copy number alteration) at any time would result in `TRUE`.  `Record [reg]` is the record ID and regimen number.

```{r, include = T}
flextable(dfp_crc_biomarkers) %>%
  autofit(.) %>%
  flextable::merge_v(j = 1) %>%
  flextable::valign(valign = "top") %>%
  fix_border_issues(.)
```

**Notes:**

- With CNAs added we see that these drugs are usually accompanied by the expected mutations.







```{r}
dft_cape_regimens <- dft_hdrug_det %>% 
  group_by(cohort, record_id, ca_seq, regimen_number) %>%
  mutate(
    regimen_contains_cape = any(agent %in% "Capecitabine"),
    regimen_contains_invalid_cape = any(agent %in% "Capecitabine" & !valid_ind_exists)
  ) %>%
  ungroup(.) %>%
  filter(regimen_contains_cape)

dft_cape_compliments <- dft_cape_regimens %>%
  group_by(cohort, record_id, ca_seq, regimen_number) %>%
  summarize(
    taken_with = paste(sort(agent[agent != "Capecitabine"]), collapse = ", "),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(taken_with = if_else(taken_with %in% "", "(monotherapy)", taken_with))

# Put the flag back in for whether these were valid/invalid.
dft_cape_compliments <- dft_cape_regimens %>%
  filter(agent %in% "Capecitabine") %>%
  select(record_id, ca_seq, regimen_number, cape_use_valid = valid_ind_exists) %>%
  left_join(
    dft_cape_compliments,
    .,
    by = c('record_id', 'ca_seq', 'regimen_number'),
    relationship = "one-to-one"
  ) 

dft_cape_comp_sum <- dft_cape_compliments %>%
  count(cape_use_valid, cohort, taken_with) %>%
  arrange(cape_use_valid, cohort, desc(n))
  
```

**Notes**

- Vemurafenib looks universally accompanied by BRAF.  Trastuzumab has some with neither.
- This currently only includes mutations.  We can include copy number alterations or fusions if appropriate, which may explain some of the results.
- The specific mutation is also not yet considered.  Is limiting to V600E better for BRAF?









### *R4.7 Drugs given with Capecitabine

This is a generalized answer to the question "Was Capecitabine given with Erlotinib often in the pancreatic cohort?".

The following table lists the drugs which accompany regimens where Capecitabine was given.  If Capecitabine was the only drug used in the regimen we just note "(monotherapy)". The counts are in strata defined by whether the use of capecitabine was valid in that regimen, and which cohort the person belongs to.

```{r, include = T}
dft_cape_comp_sum %>%
  flextable(.) %>%
  autofit(.) %>%
  align(j = 1, align = 'left', part = 'all') %>%
  merge_v(j = 1:2) %>%
  valign(j = 1:2, valign = "top") %>%
  fix_border_issues(.)
```

**Notes**

- Erlotinib was not frequently given with Capecitabine in the Pancreatic cohort.  It was given in 2 of the three off label uses in NSCLC.








## Indications sheet

The following table shows a few relevant columns from the `indications.csv` sheet.  This is not filtered, so it contains approvals from other regulators and drugs we've excluded from our analysis.

```{r, include = T}
dft_ind_mapped %>% 
  select(component, regulator, date, condition, note, 
         context, stage_or_status) %>%
  dt_wrapper(.)
```



## Issues/concerns


### Unused conditions

The Warner `indications.csv` sheet contains many conditions which didn't seem to map to any BPC cohort are:

```{r, include = T}
dft_ind_mapped %>%
  count(condition) %>%
  distinct(.) %>%
  filter(!(condition %in% dft_cw_condition$condition)) %>%
  arrange(condition) %>%
  rename(n_rows = n) %>%
  dt_wrapper(.)
```

Notes:

- The most important condition which is excluded is `"<NONE>"`.  We will need to discuss what those rows represent. 
- Not all of these conditions describe a drug used in the BPC, and not all of them describe FDA indications (which is our first target).

### Lock dates

One optimization we could do for our guesses on drug use:  Nobody's drug start date can be after the lock date of the data.  For those with a "maximum possible" over the lock date we could round down to the lock date.






### Miscellaneous from Mar 2024


```{r}

  - No.  There are `r n_ramucirumab_all` uses in the BPC cohorts, but none are from Bladder.  The only uses are in NSCLC (mostly) and CRC.
  
```{r}
n_enfortumab_bladder <- dft_hdrug_cohort %>%
  filter(agent %in% "Enfortumab Vedotin" & cohort %in% "Bladder") %>%
  nrow(.)
```

- **Question: What about enfortumab in the Bladder cohort?**
  - Used `r n_enfortumab_bladder` times total, so not a ton of data here.

- **Question: Does neuroendocrine histologic pattern explain the use of Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate?**
  - Unfortunately the relevant field from the pathology dataset,  "Prostate Cancer: Specialized Histologic Pattern (Across All Prostate Specimens", `path_pros_pat`, appears to be missing or "not noted" for 95% of samples.  Out of the 13 first and only prostate cancers with lutetium use, none had a neuroendocrine subtype noted in any of their samples.  This doesn't mean a ton with 95% missing data of course.
  - If others are aware of other BPC variables that would indicate this let me know.
  
  
```{r}
dat_prostate_ca_ind <- readr::read_rds(
  here('data', 'no_ca_seq_filter', 'clin_dat_wide.rds')
) %>%
  filter(cohort %in% "Prostate") %>%
  pull(ca_ind) %>%
  `[[`(.,1)
dat_prostate_ca_ind %<>% 
  filter(stage_dx_iv %in% "Stage IV")

dat_prostate_ca_ind %<>%
  mutate(
    ca_dmets_yn = case_when(
      str_detect(ca_dmets_yn, "No") ~ "No, S4, no dmet ...",
      T ~ ca_dmets_yn
    )
  )
```

  
  
- **Question:  Is Stage IVa the same as "Stage IV without distant mets" in prostate cancer?**

  - *Summary: We can't tell for sure, but there are no signs of a direct violation of that concept*
  - Detailed staging is covered by a few variables: (1) `best_ajcc_stage_cd` which comes from the tumor registry, and (2) `ca_stage` or `ca_path_group_stage` which come from curation if the tumor registry data is not available.  In this case (Stage IV prostate cancer), `ca_path_group_stage` and `ca_stage` are not completed by design, and `ca_stage` is not even in the datasets, so we're left with just the tumor registry data.  Here's a crosstabulation between `ca_dmets_yn` (rows, slightly rephrased for length) and `best_ajcc_stage_cd` (columns):
  
```{r, include = T}
dat_prostate_ca_ind %>%
  tabyl(
    ca_dmets_yn, best_ajcc_stage_cd
  )
```


*Notes:* The vast majority are just "4" or missing, so we don't know.  For those that are 4A, they don't have dmets, and for those that are 4B they do.  So we have few signs, but they all align with the hypothesis at least.





## Possible future work 

- Bring in genomic information for:
  - TMB in prostate.
  - BRAF or ERBB2.  We would expect one of these in CRC use of trastuzumab and vemurafenib.
- Add in checks for TNBC and possibly castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  The second one is a big dicey because the med onc notes are imperfectly used.
