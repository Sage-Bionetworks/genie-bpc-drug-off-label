Questions to answer:

- How often to regimens overlap with one another?
- What drugs are most commonly included in overlapping regimens?
- (minor) How often are dx_drug_end... and dx_drug_end_or_last_adm... different?
  - easier to do once we have drug datasets.
  
Fixes to make:
- Find a way to show some specific cases of regimens that overlap.
  - I was thinking a table, but a figure makes way more sense now that I think
